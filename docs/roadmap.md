# Roadmap

The client's Build Priority list from [`product-direction.md`](product-direction.md),
tracked here so progress survives context resets instead of being re-derived from chat or
PR history each session. Update this file in the same PR that moves an item's status.

## Build priority

1. **Hotel selection and saved Home Lantern** -- *mostly done*
   - Done: a scrollable hotel picker (`HotelAnchorPrompt` in `ui/Lantern.kt`), "Use my
     location" (on-device GPS, no account) and "I'm not staying at a hotel," all persisted
     locally (`LamplightViewModel` + `HotelAnchor`); a proactive location fetch on app open
     (`ProactiveLocationEffect`) that checks the fix against the bundled hotel catalog
     (`HotelCatalog`, `nearestHotelWithin`) and offers a one-tap "Staying at X?" confirmation
     when it lands within ~120m of a known hotel; a persistent Home Lantern FAB (top-right)
     with a "Take me back" sheet.
   - Seed data: `assets/hotels.csv` now has 185 hotels across Orleans Parish plus the
     Kenner/Metairie airport cluster, replacing the original 5-hotel starter list.
     Sourced via Wikipedia's coordinates API, OpenStreetMap Overpass queries, Nominatim
     address geocoding, and targeted web searches for renamed/rebranded properties --
     not from the client, and not claimed as literally exhaustive (background research
     put it at roughly 75-85% of all individually-nameable operating lodging in the
     metro, higher for the neighborhoods a French-Quarter-visiting guest actually books
     in). Precision matters here specifically because the proximity-match depends on it;
     every coordinate has a cited source, none are guessed.
2. **Home screen with one excellent "next move"** -- *not started*. The current home screen
   (`ExploreScreen`) is still search/filter over the full catalog, not a single
   recommendation card. This is the next screen-level piece of work.
3. **Place cards and place-detail view** -- *partial*. `MosaicPlaceCard` shows photo, name,
   and walk-time-from-hotel. `PlaceDetail` additionally shows open/closed-now status, a
   "GOOD FOR" row, and a "DETAILS" section (phone, website, address, today's hours) when the
   Places pipeline found a match (`BundledPlaceDetails`, `OpeningHours.kt`) -- tappable
   phone/website open the dialer/browser. "Good for" (`goodForTagsIn()`) is a fixed, ordered
   shortlist of the catalog's own existing tags (Family-Friendly, Solo Traveler Friendly,
   LGBTQ+, Vegan-friendly, Vegetarian-friendly, First Timer Essential, Cheap Eats, Free
   Admission, Rainy Day Option) -- no new data, no invented copy. Still missing: practical
   notes (dress code, cash/card, reservations -- would need new Places API fields like
   `paymentOptions`/`reservable` that aren't fetched today), and the **Go now** /
   **Add to tonight** / **Next nearby** actions, which depend on features later in this list
   (Tonight).
4. **"Tonight" three-to-four-stop loop** -- *not started*. Depends on #2/#3 groundwork.
5. **Maps handoff, including "Take me back"** -- *done* (this app is Android-only, so this
   is a Google Maps handoff; there's no Apple Maps counterpart to build here).
   `PlaceDetail`'s "Open in Maps" predates this work; `openWalkingDirections` in
   `ui/Lantern.kt` adds the Home Lantern's walking-directions handoff.
6. **Discover categories, especially Happy Hour** -- *done, one judgment call on
   navigation*. `discoverCategoriesFor()` maps a place's existing tags (CSV Category Tags,
   Google place-types, and vocabulary-matched review keywords -- no new data pipeline work)
   onto the client's fixed eight categories (Drinks, Food, Happy Hour, Music, Shops, Indoor,
   Late, History); a place can land in any number of them, including zero, since most of the
   catalog's 157 distinct tags describe something more specific than these eight
   deliberately broad buckets. `DiscoverScreen` (`ui/Discover.kt`) shows the eight as a list
   (short new category-level taglines, no invented per-venue editorial copy), each opening
   onto a staggered photo grid filtered to matching places -- a separate, simpler card than
   `MosaicPlaceCard` (photo and name only, no save/visited/featured/walk-time), not a reuse
   of it: that composable is file-private to `LamplightApp.kt`. Reachable via a new compass
   icon next to the mood/vibe icon on the home screen -- the brief's own bottom-nav
   placement is blocked on the Home/Tonight/Discover nav structure (item 8's own blocker)
   not existing yet, so this is the lightest-weight entry point consistent with today's UI,
   not a claim that it's the final placement. 7 new unit tests
   (`DiscoverCategoriesTest`) cover the mapping directly; the screen itself isn't visually
   verified (no emulator/browser in this sandbox).
7. **Persona copy/ranking layer** -- *done, as a ranking signal*. `MoodRanking.kt`'s
   `moodRelevanceScore()` reads the group-size/vibe answers `MoodPrompt` already collects and
   folds them into Explore's sort (Featured, then mood score, then proximity) -- the same
   "boost, never filter" philosophy as Featured itself (item 3/6's own precedent), so no
   combination of answers can ever empty the grid. Grounded in real tags wherever a direct
   match exists (Family-Friendly, First Timer/Tourist Essential, Solo Traveler Friendly are
   literal tags; Food First/Cocktails First/Music Tonight/Rain Plan reuse Discover's own
   category membership from item 6). The other 7 vibes are a curated subset of real tags, a
   genuine judgment call documented in the file -- there's no "romantic" or "business-safe"
   column in the data. Two answers deliberately contribute nothing rather than a guessed
   something: Low Walking (proximity is already a tiebreaker regardless of vibe) and the 2-4/
   5+ group sizes (no group-size tag exists in this catalog beyond solo). 12 new unit tests
   cover the mapping directly; not visually verified (no emulator/browser in this sandbox).
8. **Lantern List** -- *partial, and diverging from spec*. Saved/Been There are now filter
   chips on the single Explore screen rather than separate tabs (the bottom navigation bar
   was removed entirely), but still aren't organized into the brief's Tonight/Later/Next
   trip sections. Decided 2026-08-29: "Been There" stays exactly as it works today, but its
   results now carry a "NEXT TRIP -- worth another look?" header while that filter is
   active -- a lightweight placeholder for this item's eventual Tonight/Later/Next-trip
   structure, not the full section-based screen itself, which is still not built.

## Not in the original build-priority list, now in progress or queued

- **Business details and richer search tags** -- *done*. `scripts/fetch_place_photos.py`
  now fetches phone, website, address, and opening hours alongside photos, plus Google's
  place `types` and a small set of terms matched against review text against a fixed
  vocabulary (`REVIEW_KEYWORD_VOCABULARY`) -- review text itself is discarded immediately
  and never written to `place_details_manifest.json` or bundled into the app in any form.
  `BundledPlaceDetails.kt` loads it; `OpeningHours.kt` derives open/closed-now from the
  structured hours. The enriched tags widen free-text search (`ExploreScreen`); Explore has
  no per-tag chips at all any more (see "Trimmed Explore's filter chips" below), curated or
  otherwise -- by-tag filtering is search's job now.
- **Group size and vibe questions** -- *selectors done, no recommendation logic yet*.
  `GroupSize` (Solo/2-4/5+) and `Vibe` (all 16 from the shelved Brief 1 pricing spec:
  Romantic, Curious, Business-Safe, etc.) in `Models.kt`, persisted like the hotel anchor.
  `MoodPrompt` (`ui/Mood.kt`) shows both questions together on one screen, reachable from a
  top-left icon button and shown once on first open (yielding to a pending hotel-detection
  confirmation rather than stacking dialogs). Kept as free selectors without reviving Brief
  1's paywall around them. Nothing reads these values yet to actually change what's
  recommended or how results are ranked -- that's the persona/vibe-driven layer, item 7
  below, not yet built.
- **Seen, as its own thing from Been** -- *done*. "Seen" (`LamplightViewModel.isSeen`/
  `markSeen`) is a new, auto-tracked record of having opened a place's detail screen at
  least once, with no "un-see." "Been" is untouched: still a deliberate manual toggle for an
  actual real-world visit. Both are separate filter chips (Saved / Been / Seen) on Explore.
- **"Been" reframed as "Next Trip"** -- decided 2026-08-29: rather than "Been" folding away
  or becoming a distinct third toggle, it stays exactly as it works today (still a plain
  manual visited flag, still the same filter chip), but the results shown while that filter
  is active now carry a "NEXT TRIP -- worth another look?" header, reframing the same data
  as revisit candidates rather than inventing a second stored concept. A lightweight
  placeholder for the Lantern List's eventual Tonight/Later/Next-trip sections (item 8
  below), not a build-out of that whole screen yet.
- **Trimmed Explore's filter chips** -- decided 2026-08-29: dropped the "All" chip and the
  one-chip-per-distinct-tag row entirely (the curated CSV vocabulary alone runs into the
  dozens); Saved/Been/Seen/Featured are the only chips now, and by-tag filtering is search's
  job (it already matched tags, see the "Business details" entry above).
  `LamplightViewModel.tags` (the now-unused distinct-tag list that fed the removed chip row)
  was removed along with it.
- **Typography** -- *done*. Uncut Sans has no confirmed license for bundling; Archivo (SIL
  OFL, Google Fonts, true Black weight) replaces it as the app-wide default. Martian Mono
  (already cleared as license-safe, but not actually wired up until now) is applied at the
  utility-label call sites the brief names. See `design-system.md`.
- **Monetization**: confirmed business-side (e.g. paid placement or a claimed/verified
  listing), not a consumer paywall -- Brief 1's Free/One Night/One Week tiers stay shelved.
  Decided 2026-08-29: hand-editing the CSV's `Featured` column stays the mechanism for now,
  no automated claim/payment flow being built.
- **Featured, as a filter, a tag, and now a sort order** -- `Place.featured` (`Models.kt`) is
  a sixth CSV column (`quartermuse_master_v11.csv`, `Featured` = `TRUE`/`FALSE`), defaulting
  `FALSE` on all 419 existing rows. Explore has a "Featured" filter chip alongside
  Saved/Been/Seen; a featured place also gets a small amber "FEATURED" badge on its mosaic
  card and its detail screen. Decided 2026-08-29 (resolving the client brief's "curated
  highlights vs. show everything" question): Explore's default sort is now Featured-first,
  proximity breaking ties within each group -- a sort-order change only, not a filter, so the
  grid never empties. Zero venues are marked Featured today, so this has no visible effect
  yet until the CSV is hand-edited, which is expected.
- **Expanded content catalogs**: background research compiled more-comprehensive lists of
  New Orleans hotels, restaurants/bars, and landmarks/parks/tourist-activities, at the
  user's explicit request overriding the client brief's "deliberately small, curated
  list... not an inventory dump" principle for the venue catalog. All three are done.
  - **Hotels**: see item 1 above -- a separate catalog from the venue CSV, used only for
    the picker and proximity match, so "complete" was never in tension with the curation
    principle there. 185 hotels, replacing the original 5-hotel starter list.
  - **Landmarks/parks/tourist-activities**: 64 new rows appended directly to
    `quartermuse_master_v11.csv`, same schema, checked against the pre-existing 143 venues
    for duplicates before merging (one, the Old U.S. Mint / New Orleans Jazz Museum, was
    already present under a different name and wasn't re-added). One tag was normalized on
    merge: the research used "Historic Landmark," the catalog's existing convention is
    "Historic Site" -- all 64 rows were rewritten to match before appending.
  - **Restaurants/bars**: 272 candidate rows researched; 22 with no sourced coordinate were
    excluded rather than guessed at (kept out of the catalog entirely -- see the research
    agent's own report for the excluded names if they're worth manually geocoding later).
    Of the remaining 250, 38 turned out to already be in the catalog (26 by exact id
    collision, 12 by exact case-insensitive name match once ids differed) and were skipped
    in favor of the existing curated entry. The other 212 were appended, tags normalized to
    the catalog's "; "-separated convention.
  - **Result**: `quartermuse_master_v11.csv` grew from 143 to 419 venues (420 lines
    including header). This is a real, deliberate departure from "deliberately small,
    curated" for raw count -- the user's call, made explicitly and more than once. Whether
    Explore/Discover need a "show me the curated highlights" vs. "show me everything"
    distinction now that the catalog is 3x its original size is an open design question,
    not yet raised with the user.
- **Kotlin Multiplatform + a web target, at the user's explicit request** -- *the approved
  10-PR sequence is complete; real end-to-end web verification (a live Pages check, actual
  browser behavior for geolocation/etc., the still-deferred photo-copying CI step) is what's
  left*. Adds a shareable web build (reached via a link or QR code, not meant to be
  search-discoverable) alongside the existing Android app, one shared UI/logic codebase for
  both, using Compose Multiplatform's web target (Kotlin/Wasm -- JetBrains labels this Beta,
  not stable, a risk accepted deliberately rather than glossed over). Also bumps the whole
  toolchain to current latest stable, and JDK to 21, per request. A 10-PR sequence, each
  keeping Android shippable throughout -- never breaking it to make progress on web:
  - **PR0** *(merged)*: JDK 21, Kotlin 2.4.10, `core-ktx` 1.19.0 (everything else was already
    latest stable), and a new `gradle/libs.versions.toml` version catalog, all on the
    then-single `:app` module.
  - **PR1** *(merged, #28 -- PR #27, "PR0," was itself only version bumps with no
    multiplatform code, which read as if nothing was happening; #28 is where the actual
    module split landed)*: split `:app` into `:shared` (a Kotlin Multiplatform library,
    `androidTarget()` only for now) and `:androidApp` (a thin `com.android.application`
    shell) -- zero commonMain, zero expect/actual yet, every file moved unchanged. Real AGP-9
    gotchas surfaced and resolved along the way, worth recording since they're easy to
    re-trip on in later PRs: an Android-targeted KMP library now needs
    `com.android.kotlin.multiplatform.library` (applied *alongside*, not instead of,
    `kotlin("multiplatform")`) rather than the older `com.android.library` combo; its DSL is
    new (`kotlin { android { ... } }`, `jvmToolchain(21)`, `withHostTest {}`, an
    `androidHostTest` source set replacing `androidUnitTest`); it needs
    `androidResources { enable = true }` explicitly or its own R class never generates; a
    library-module manifest needs fully-qualified component names, not `.MainActivity`-style
    relative ones, once its Gradle namespace differs from its classes' actual package; and
    manifest-referenced app-identity resources (the launcher icon, `app_name`, the base
    theme, `file_paths.xml`) needed to move into `:androidApp` itself rather than staying in
    `:shared`, since this plugin doesn't merge a KMP library's `res/` into a consuming app's
    build the way a classic library does. Most consequentially: the bare `test` Gradle task
    silently stopped running any of `:shared`'s unit tests at all (no error, just zero tests
    executed) -- CI's `./gradlew test assembleDebug`/`assembleRelease` are now
    `./gradlew allTests assembleDebug`/`assembleRelease`, the aggregate task that actually
    covers every Kotlin target's tests (and will keep covering wasmJs's once PR2 adds it).
  - **PR3** *(done ahead of PR2, #29 -- it didn't need the wasmJs work, which was still being
    researched)*: `Models.kt`, `Csv.kt`, `WalkTime.kt` moved into `commonMain`. Scope
    narrowed from the original plan on closer inspection: `OpeningHours.kt` turned out to use
    `java.time.*` throughout (not caught by an Android-import check, since that's a JVM-
    standard-library dependency, not an Android one) and needs a real `kotlinx-datetime`
    port, not a pure relocate -- still not done as of PR2, now that PR2 gives `:shared` an
    actual second target to verify it against. `WalkTime.kt` had the same category of hidden
    issue in miniature (`Math.toRadians`, resolved with no visible import) -- fixed in place.
    Full detail in `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR2** *(this one)*: added a `wasmJs` target to `:shared` and a new `:webApp` module,
    with a `SharedTransitionLayout`/`sharedBounds` spike screen proving the shared-element
    transition this app's mosaic-to-detail hero animation depends on actually works on
    wasmJs, not just Android -- the single biggest technical risk in the plan, now resolved
    at the compile/API level. Wired up GitHub Pages deployment in CI
    (`build-web`/`deploy-web` jobs). Real Compose Multiplatform, not just Android Compose
    relocated -- `org.jetbrains.compose.*` multiplatform artifacts in `commonMain`, alongside
    the existing `androidx.compose.*` ones the pre-existing Android-only UI still uses (both
    coexist fine; JetBrains' Android-target Compose Multiplatform artifacts are themselves
    backed by the corresponding AndroidX ones). This sandbox's network policy blocks the
    Kotlin/Wasm toolchain's Node.js/Yarn setup (a GitHub-tarball fetch, `codeload.github.com`,
    is disallowed), so `allTests` and the actual `wasmJsBrowserDistribution` build couldn't be
    verified end-to-end locally -- verified instead: both wasmJs targets compile clean, and
    Android is fully unaffected (all 28 `:shared` tests, both APK variants). See
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`'s PR2 section for the full gotcha list. Real CI is the
    verification point for the actual web build and live Pages deploy.
  - **PR4** *(this one)*: added the `SettingsStore` seam (`commonMain`) with
    `AndroidSettingsStore` (`SharedPreferences`, unchanged behavior) and `BrowserSettingsStore`
    (`localStorage`, via the `kotlinx-browser` library). Narrower than the original plan's
    wording implied: `LamplightViewModel` itself stays in `androidMain` for now -- it still
    depends on `Application`/`Context`, `Location`, and the entire Android-only GitHub-update
    surface that PR9 is what actually extracts, so moving it early would mean either a class
    that still doesn't compile for wasmJs or doing later PRs' work out of order. It now
    constructs its own `AndroidSettingsStore` internally instead of raw `SharedPreferences`;
    real constructor injection (needed once `:webApp` also constructs the class) arrives with
    PR9. All 28 `:shared` tests and both APK variants still green. Full detail in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR5** *(this one)*: added the `LocationProvider`/`GeoPosition` seam (`commonMain`),
    replacing `android.location.Location` everywhere it's read. `AndroidLocationProvider`
    wraps the existing `requestOneTimeLocation` unchanged; `Lantern.kt`'s two location-using
    composables now go through it. `BrowserLocationProvider` -- this plan's flagged unknown --
    wraps `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition` via a single `@JsFun`-bridged JS callback
    resolving a plain string, sidestepping the more failure-prone structured-object marshaling
    a naive port would need. Compiles clean on wasmJs, but **actual browser runtime behavior
    is not verified in this sandbox** (same `codeload.github.com` block as PR2) -- a real
    manual check belongs on the live Pages deploy once a web onboarding flow calls it (PR9).
    `LamplightViewModel` and `Lantern.kt` both stay in `androidMain` for now, same reasoning
    as PR4. All 28 `:shared` tests and both APK variants still green. Full detail in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR6** *(this one)*: added `rememberUrlOpener()` (`commonMain`, Android `Intent` /
    web `window.open`), applied to `PlaceDetail`'s phone/website rows and `openMaps` (the
    last now opens a cross-platform Google Maps URL instead of the Android-only `geo:`
    scheme -- a small real behavior change on Android, still opens the Maps app there).
    `openWalkingDirections` deliberately left untouched: its Maps-app-then-web-fallback
    logic doesn't fit the opener's plain "open this URL" shape without a real design
    decision, better made in PR9 alongside `Lantern.kt`'s actual move to `commonMain`. All
    28 `:shared` tests and both APK variants still green. Full detail in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR7** *(this one)*: rewrote `PhotoAttribution` to drop `AndroidView`/`TextView`/
    `Html.fromHtml` entirely in favor of `buildAnnotatedString` + `withLink(LinkAnnotation.Url(...))`
    -- core Compose text APIs, so this is a straight quality improvement on Android with no
    new dependency and no `commonMain` seam needed at all. Compiled clean on the first try.
    All 28 `:shared` tests and both APK variants still green. Full detail in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR8, fonts sub-piece** *(split from the original plan)*: moved the Archivo/Martian
    Mono TTFs and `Theme.kt` itself to `commonMain`, using Compose Multiplatform's
    resource-aware `Font(...)`. Most of the real work was getting Compose Resources' code
    generation to run at all (`generateResClass` needed forcing to `always` -- its default
    `Auto` heuristic doesn't fire for this module) and adding the runtime library
    (`org.jetbrains.compose.components:components-resources`) the generated code needs to
    compile.
  - **PR8's remaining scope** *(this one -- CSV/JSON, photo binaries, loading state)*: moved
    the venue/hotel CSVs and both their loaders to `commonMain` (`suspend`, `Res.readBytes`).
    `BundledPhotos`/`BundledPlaceDetails` had a second hidden Android-only dependency this
    plan's "Android imports only" check missed: `org.json.*`, replaced with
    `kotlinx.serialization.json`'s `JsonElement` tree navigation. A third hidden dependency,
    the `file:///android_asset/...` URI construction inside `BundledPhotos`, is now the
    `photoBaseUri()` seam (Android unchanged; wasmJs returns a relative `"photos/"` path).
    `LamplightViewModel`'s four eager catalog properties are now backed by a `Catalog?`
    loaded once via `viewModelScope.launch`, degrading to empty/`false` while loading rather
    than needing a dedicated loading screen -- existing call sites needed zero changes. Two
    things deliberately **not yet done**, flagged rather than silently left: the CI step that
    copies photo binaries into the web build (so `photoBaseUri()`'s web path currently 404s,
    a real but non-crashing gap -- `build-web` doesn't run `fetch_place_photos.py` at all
    today), and any real verification of the JSON loaders against actual manifest data
    (gitignored, only ever exists after a live Places API fetch this sandbox has no
    credentials to run -- only the graceful-empty path was exercised here). All 28 `:shared`
    tests (including the two relocated CSV suites) and both APK variants still green. Full
    detail, including the exact scope of what "not yet done" means, in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR9, complete**: `coil-compose` moved from `io.coil-kt:coil-compose:2.7.0`
    (Android-only) to `io.coil-kt.coil3:coil-compose:3.6.0` (the multiplatform rewrite),
    `coil-network-ktor3` deliberately deferred until `AsyncImage` actually needs real HTTP
    fetches on web. `LamplightViewModel`'s GitHub-releases self-update state/logic extracted
    into a new `GitHubUpdateController` (`androidMain`), exactly the "extract before moving
    the rest of the class" step this doc's plan called for -- fed into `LamplightApp`'s new
    `platformBanner` slot via a new `AndroidUpdateBanner` composable that `MainActivity`
    constructs and passes in, replacing the old inline `UpdateBanner`/`playUpdateStatus`
    logic. `LamplightViewModel` itself then moved to `commonMain` (constructor now takes
    `SettingsStore` directly, extends the multiplatform `ViewModel`), along with `Mood.kt`
    (no changes needed), `Lantern.kt` (needed two new seams: `rememberWalkingDirectionsOpener()`
    for the deferred `openWalkingDirections` app-then-web logic from PR6, and
    `rememberLocationRequester()` wrapping Android's permission-prompt dance so the browser's
    own automatic prompt is all web needs), and `LamplightApp.kt` itself -- this doc's own
    "biggest and riskiest single file" -- which needed `java.time` replaced with
    `kotlinx-datetime` 0.8.0, the AGP-generated `R` class replaced with Compose Resources'
    `Res.drawable`, and `androidx.activity.compose.BackHandler` (no multiplatform equivalent)
    given the same expect/actual treatment as everything else (a no-op on web). Finally wired
    `:webApp`'s actual entry point to construct the real `LamplightViewModel`/`LamplightApp`
    instead of the PR2 spike screen (now deleted) -- not spelled out as its own PR line item,
    but the actual point of moving the UI to `commonMain` in the first place. Also restyled
    the lamppost watermark per direct feedback (full screen height, behind the whole home
    screen, not just the explore header) -- not visually verified, no emulator or browser
    available in this sandbox to check it against. All 28 `:shared` tests, both wasmJs
    targets, and both APK variants still green throughout. Full detail in
    `kmp-web-migration-plan.md`.
  - **PR10, complete**: `codeql.yml`'s JDK pin (19, predating this migration) now matches
    the rest of the project's 21; `build-web` gets the same "Report Failure to Jules"
    auto-issue-filing `build-and-release` already had. Final Android-parity check: signing,
    versioning, and the sideload update flow are all a straight extraction, not a rewrite,
    and untouched Android-only surfaces (`MainActivity`, manifest, signing config) confirm
    it -- though, same as the watermark restyle above, with no on-device verification
    possible in this sandbox. See [`kmp-web-migration-plan.md`](kmp-web-migration-plan.md)
    for the full detail and the risks that carry forward past this plan's own scope (browser
    floor, bundle size, the deferred web photo-copying CI step from PR8, a Google Maps
    Platform compliance question worth a real check before publishing bundled photo content
    to a public static site).
- **`js` compatibility target** -- decided 2026-08-29, following up on the approved 10-PR
  sequence above: added `js { browser() }` alongside `wasmJs { browser() }` to both `:shared`
  and `:webApp`, as a fallback for browsers below wasmJs's WasmGC floor (Chrome 119+/Firefox
  120+/Safari 18.2+). Verified for real, not assumed: Compose Multiplatform's own Gradle plugin
  runs a `checkJsMainComposeLibrariesCompatibility` task and both `compileKotlinJs` tasks
  succeed, `ComposeViewport` resolves identically on both targets, and `jsProcessResources`
  produces the same `index.html` plus Skiko's own `skiko.wasm`/`skiko.mjs` pair -- Skiko's
  renderer uses a separate, baseline (non-GC) WASM module under `js` too, which is *why* this
  floor is genuinely lower (baseline WASM has near-universal support since ~2017). A custom
  `webMain` intermediate source set (explicit `dependsOn`, not Kotlin's default hierarchy
  template) holds the browser-interop code identical across both targets --
  `BrowserSettingsStore`, `PhotoBaseUri`, `UrlOpener`/walking-directions, `BackHandler`, and
  even `:webApp`'s `main()` and `index.html`. `BrowserLocationProvider` stays duplicated per
  target on purpose: the JS-interop mechanism itself differs (`@JsFun` vs. plain Kotlin/JS's
  `js("...")` intrinsic), not just the code shape. All existing tests, both wasmJs and js
  compiles, and both APK variants still green. **Scope check, stated plainly**: this makes both
  modules *compile* for `js` -- it does not yet reach a real user. CI still only builds and
  deploys the wasmJs bundle; nothing detects WasmGC support or serves the `js` bundle instead.
  That's flagged as its own open item in `TODO.md` rather than folded in here, since it's a
  real product tradeoff (a heavier page-load path for the fallback case), not a mechanical
  follow-on to the target existing.
- **Lamp watermark glow, signaling area/state** -- decided 2026-09-07, at the user's explicit
  request. The lamp watermark (previously a plain static image, Home-only) now carries a soft
  colored glow behind its lantern housing (`ui/LampGlow.kt`'s `LampWatermark`), and appears on
  Discover and Place Detail too, not just Home. Color comes from `lampGlowColorFor(featured,
  saved, visited, seen)`: Featured > Saved > Visited ("Been"/Next Trip) > Seen > the plain
  brand amber when none apply -- the same priority Explore's own sort already gives Featured.
  Explore/Home's glow reflects whichever filter chip is active (the four filter booleans were
  hoisted from `ExploreScreen` up to `LamplightHome`, which needs to read them); Place Detail's
  glow reflects the one viewed place's own flags instead, animating into "seen" the moment a
  never-opened place's `markSeen` effect fires; Discover gets a fixed teal "area" color, since
  it has no single place's state to reflect. **A deliberate exception to `Theme.kt`'s own
  documented rule** ("amber is the only bright accent... never a second hue") -- that rule is
  explicitly about interactive chrome (buttons/chips/icons), which stays amber-only exactly as
  before; this ambient, non-interactive signal is the one place multiple hues were a considered
  choice, not an oversight, per direct instruction to use "distinct hues per state" over
  staying within the amber family. Verified: all three targets compile, `testAndroidHostTest`
  (including 5 new `LampGlowTest` cases covering the priority order) and both APK variants all
  pass. **Not verified**: the glow's actual on-screen position and sizing against the real
  artwork -- `LampHousingFraction` (where the lantern sits, as a fraction of the watermark's
  height) is a reasoned estimate, not a measurement, since this sandbox can't render Compose UI
  visually. Worth a real look on-device/in-browser before considering this done.

## Explicitly out of scope for now

Per the client brief's "Explicitly Do Not Build" list -- see `product-direction.md` and
`design-system.md` for the full list and the reasoning. Brief 1's user-facing subscription
tiers stay shelved regardless of what shape business-side monetization eventually takes.

## Success test

> A hotel guest who has no plan can open Lamplight, choose a hotel, get somewhere genuinely
> good within ten minutes, and easily find their way back afterward.

Item 1 (this PR) and item 5 get the "find their way back" half working end to end. The
"get somewhere genuinely good" half needs items 2-3 before that test is actually passable.
